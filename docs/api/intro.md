# API Documentation

Welcome to the Clearshore API documentation. This section provides comprehensive information about our REST APIs, including endpoints, request/response formats, authentication, and examples.

## Getting Started

Our APIs are built with modern REST principles and follow industry standards. All endpoints return JSON responses and use standard HTTP status codes.

### Base URL

All API requests should be made to:
```
https://api.clearshore.com/v1
```

### Authentication

Most endpoints require authentication using API keys. Include your API key in the request header:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Rate Limiting

API requests are rate limited to 1000 requests per hour per API key. Rate limit information is included in response headers.

## Quick Start

1. **Get an API Key**: Sign up for a Clearshore account and generate an API key
2. **Make your first request**: Try our [Health Check endpoint](/api/health)
